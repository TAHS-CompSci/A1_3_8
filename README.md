# A1_3_8 While Loops

Young Padawan, your training in the basic skills of Python force training is almost complete. With the completion of this activity you will be ready to attempt the trials for basic skills users. 

In this activity you are tasked with creating a while loop that allows a program or script to continually run until a user elects to 'quit' the program. The lack of hints here is intentional. Use your knowledge and think through this problem - only then will the answers reveal themselves. 

*This may be completed for any of the missions given in A1_3_7. 

Good luck and may the force be with you. 

## Activity Submission

Make sure that you are downloading a Python doc from your notebook. Also be sure to place the fresh script in your repository under your branch! 

Once completed be sure to submit your commit.
